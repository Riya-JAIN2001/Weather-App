# Weather App

This project is a simple weather application that allows users to retrieve weather information for a specific city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Description

The Weather App fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on the user's input of a city name. It displays the current temperature, humidity, and wind speed, along with an icon representing the weather condition. Users can enter a city name and press enter or click the search button to get the weather information.

## Features

- User-friendly interface
- Real-time weather updates
- Weather icon representation
- Error handling for invalid city names

## Getting Started

To run the Weather App, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

1. Enter the name of the city for which you want to check the weather in the input field.
2. Press Enter or click the search button.
3. The weather information for the specified city will be displayed.

## API Key

This project uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. You need to obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap and replace the `apiKey` variable in the JavaScript code (`script` tag in `index.html`) with your API key.

```javascript
const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
```
